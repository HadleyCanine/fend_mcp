# THE C.R.A.Y.O.N. LICENSE, v1.0; An ethical source license

(Colorful Rules Against Your Oppressive Nemeses)

## Conditions (Who CAN'T use this?)

This Software is free to use, modify, and distribute by anyone as they see fit, except for those who fit *ANY* of the following criteria:
- Is using this Software for an organization (including any parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related corporate entities) with a legal team on payroll
- Is a member of law enforcement, military, or any intelligence agency (or a primary contractor thereof)
- Profits from any form of wage theft
- Utilizes offshore tax havens to avoid taxation
- Engages in union-busting or refuses to recognise employee unions
- Is a fascist, white supremacist, Christian nationalist, nazi, or associates with any similar inherently oppressive groups or movements
- Thinks that "they're calling *everybody* nazis these days"

Anyone made ineligible by these conditions may contact the author to negotiate an alternative license at the author's sole discretion (and/or amusement).

## How Can I Use This?

This Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. You know what that means, don't be a jerk.

Any derivative work or modification of this Software must be licensed under the C.R.A.Y.O.N. License.

## In case of license disputes

As the legal systems (sometimes erroneously referred to as a justice system) remains notoriously inaccessible for those who need them most, any and all disputes regarding this license will be settled not in a court of law, but in **melee combat** at the sole discretion of the author of this Software. The sole condition for victory shall be one party's clear and unambiguous verbal declaration of "I surrender!", or if they fail to do so, their incapacitation.

To counteract the unfair advantages afforded to the wealthy and powerful, the Software author retains the sole and exclusive right to wield a weapon of their choice during said combat. When a dispute involves a hierarchical organization, the participant representing said organization shall be its highest-ranking officer or leader.

## The Bottom Line

To ensure truly free software, some non-free restrictions on its use for those who would use it to squash freedom are necessary, as per the paradox of tolerance. A truly free and inclusive society cannot be tolerant of those who would use that freedom to build hierarchies and enforce oppression.

If you're a big company, this isn't for you. If our terms make you uncomfortable, it is likely that you are part of the problem.
